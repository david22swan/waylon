# Contributing to Waylon
Third-party patches are essential for keeping Waylon great. We want to keep it
as easy as possible to contribute changes that get things working in your
environment. There are a few guidelines we need contributors to follow so that
we can have a chance of staying on top of things.

## Getting Started
* Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/join).
* Submit a ticket for your issue, assuming one does not already exist.
  * Clearly describe the issue, and any steps needed to reproduce it.
  * The version or SHA of the software you're using.
* Fork the repository on GitHub.

## Making Changes
* Create a topic branch from where you want to base your work.
  * Work should typically be based on the `master` branch.
  * To quickly create a topic branch based on master:
  `git checkout -b my-contribution master`.
    * Except for trivial changes, please avoid working directly on the `master`
    branch.
* Make commits of logical units.

### Trivial Changes
For trivial changes to comments and documentation, it's not always necessary to
create a new ticket or topic branch. Please, use your best judgement.

### Style Guidelines
Before submitting your pull request, please consider the following:
  * Check for unnecessary whitespace with `git diff --check`. All tabs should
  be expanded to spaces; hard tabs will not be accepted.
  * Please keep line length to around 79-80 characters. We understand that
  this isn't always practical, just use your best judgement.
  * Include comments where appropriate.
  * No additional copyright statements or licenses.
  * Make sure your commit message is in the proper format:

  ```
  Make the example in CONTRIBUTING imperative and concrete

  Without this patch applied, the contributor is left to
  imagine what the commit message should look like based
  on a description rather than an example.

  The first line is a real-life statement, potentially with
  a ticket number from the issue tracker. The body describes
  the behavior without the patch, why it's a problem, and
  how the patch fixes the problem when applied.
  ```

When in doubt, consult the [GitHub Styleguide](https://github.com/styleguide).

## Submitting Changes
* Push your changes to a topic branch in your fork of the repository.
* Submit a pull request to Waylon's main GitHub repository,
[rji/waylon](https://github.com/rji/waylon).
* Update any outstanding tickets (if applicable) to mention that you have
submitted code, and provide a link / reference to the pull request.
